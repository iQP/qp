This project will be a "Question/Poll Generator".
The difference between the two will be how the answers are treated. In a "Question" the answers will be individual while the "poll" will be stats over the whole number of answers.

The user(admin) creating a question paper will have the possibility to assign it to 1 or more candidates. He will also be able to put the paper public or private. In private mode, the candidate will have to authentify himself to answer while in public mode any one who get the link to the question paper will be able to access it. The same rules apply for the poll. The admin will be able to request for personnal informations

All candidates(users) will be identified by their emails. Their prersonal informations will be requested (name, surname ...) whatever the "admin" will request.

The developpers will have to take into consideration user side(or should I say browser side specifications.) Min requirements will be for ie 7 and very important, MUST CONSIDER THE USER INTERFACE RUNNING WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT. The project will be developped using the symfony2.5 edition framework.

The whole will be licenced under MIT. Yes everything will be free and opensource.
